Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.
=> 
Absolute:-
    (i) Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if none exist).
    (ii) Used for elements that need to be positioned precisely without affecting other elements.
    (iii) Descendant elements can be positioned absolutely relative to this element.
    (iv) Can be used with z-index to control stacking order.


Relative:-
    (i) Positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
    (ii) Used to adjust the position of elements without removing them from the document flow.
    (iii) No effect on the positioning context for descendant elements.
    (iv) Can also be used with z-index, but affects stacking order relative to original position.
